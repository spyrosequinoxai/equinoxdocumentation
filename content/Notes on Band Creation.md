* Current logic of bands is hidden and exists in TS only, this means we can not execute data science related tests on it
* There is a big ambiguity regarding the spreads and the funding models, they are also fixed which doesn't enable much experimentation.

One thing I changed and plan to continue like this: 
* Rename the entry/exit to ask/bid. It is IMPORTANT that every term used in the codebase is not according to our preference but rather adherent to the official terminology.
